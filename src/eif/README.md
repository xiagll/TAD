# Extended Isolation Forest

This is a simple package implementation for the Extended Isolation Forest method. It is an improvement on the original algorithm Isolation Forest which is described (among other places) in this [paper](icdm08b.pdf) for detecting anomalies and outliers from a data point distribution. The original code can be found at [https://github.com/mgckind/iso_forest](https://github.com/mgckind/iso_forest)

For an *N* dimensional data set, Extended Isolation Forest has *N* levels of extension, with *0* being identical to the case of standard Isolation Forest, and *N-1* being the fully extended version.

## Installation


    pip install eif


or directly from the repository


    pip install git+https://github.com/sahandha/eif.git
